h1. Classy CAS

Classy CAS is (or rather, will be) a "CAS compliant":http://www.jasig.org/cas/protocol server that will allow centralized authentication across a number of sites and environments.  For now, it's a weekend exercise.

h2. What's There

* "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ based.  Classy.
* Uses "Redis":http://code.google.com/p/redis/ to store tickets.  Fast!
* Lots of tests.  The whole protocol isn't there yet, but "this test":http://github.com/AndrewO/ClassyCAS/blob/master/test/protocol/cas_server_test.rb is a good start on an executable spec for CAS 1.0/2.0.

h2. What's Missing

* Proxy authentication.
* Logout support.
* Plugable authentication stores.  I'm thinking of "Warden":http://github.com/hassox/warden or "Devise":http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/tag/devise/
* Lots of code cleanup.  The tests and the application all need a hearty helping of TLC before they're production ready.

h2. Resources

* "CAS":http://www.jasig.org/cas
* "RubyCAS Server":http://github.com/gunark/rubycas-server, an existing CAS implementation written on top of Camping.  At times when the spec has been unclear, I've tried to stick to what RubyCAS does.
